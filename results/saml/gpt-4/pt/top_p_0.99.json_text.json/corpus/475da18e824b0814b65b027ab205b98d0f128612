An array of bytes that, when decompressed by the `flate.NewReader`, results in a total length that is over 100 times larger than the initial compressed input. This would cause the function to panic with `too high ratio`. However, what this specific string or byte array might be exactly depends on how flate algorithm handles compression and could potentially be very large or complex. An exact example cannot be provided without more context about your application.
