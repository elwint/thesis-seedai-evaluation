 (1) The first pSrc bytes of s are the common prefix.
// 2. nDst is the length of a common prefix: the first pDst bytes of s are the
// common prefix and len(s) is the largest such value.
// 3. pDst is the length of a common prefix: the first pDst bytes of s are the
// common prefix and len(s) is the largest such value.
// 4. pSrc is the length of a common prefix: the first pSrc bytes of s are the
// common prefix and len(s) is the largest such value.
// 5. If err == nil, nDst and nSrc are equal to 0, then we don't need to allocate a new
// result string.
